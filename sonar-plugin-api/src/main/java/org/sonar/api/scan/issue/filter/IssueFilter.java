   * The <code>accept</code> method is called for each {@link FilterableIssue} created during analysis, to check if it has to be persisted. Examples of use cases are:
   * <ul>
   *  <li>Ignoring or enforcing rules on specific resources</li>
   *  <li>Switching-off an issue based on its context (<code>//NOSONAR</code> comments, semantic annotations)</li>
   * </ul>

   * the {@link IssueFilterChain#accept} method, or return directly if the issue has to be accepted or not
   * 
   * Implementations should be thread safe.
   * 
   * @param issue the issue being filtered
   * @param chain the rest of the filters
   * @return <code>true</code> to accept the issue, <code>false</code> to reject it, {@link IssueFilterChain#accept} to let the other filters decide.
