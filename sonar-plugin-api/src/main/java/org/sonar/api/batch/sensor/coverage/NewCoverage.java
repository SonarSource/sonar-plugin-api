 * This class is used to report code coverage on files.

 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   sensorContext.newCoverage().onFile(file)
       .lineHits(1, 2)
       .lineHits(2, 5)
       .lineHits(3, 0)
       . ...
       .conditions(3, 4, 2)
       .conditions(12, 2, 2)
       . ...
       .save();
 *     
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Since 6.2 you can save several reports for the same file and reports will be merged using the following "additive" strategy:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Line hits are cumulated</li>
 *   <li>We keep the max for condition coverage. Examples: 2/4 + 2/4 = 2/4, 2/4 + 3/4 = 3/4</li>
 * </ul>
