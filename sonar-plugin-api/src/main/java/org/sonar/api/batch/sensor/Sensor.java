/**
 * <p>
 * A sensor is invoked once for each module of a project, starting from leaf modules. The sensor can parse a flat file, connect to a web server... Sensors are
 * used to add measure and issues at file level.
 * <p>
 * For example the Cobertura Sensor parses Cobertura report and saves the first-level of measures on files.
 * 
 * For testing purpose you can use SensorContextTester, available in sonar-plugin-api-impl
 * @since 5.1
 * @since 7.6 use {@link ProjectSensor} instead to make your Sensor run only once per analysis, and no more once per module
