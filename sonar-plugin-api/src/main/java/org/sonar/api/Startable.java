/**
 * An interface which is implemented by classes annotated with {@link org.sonar.api.scanner.ScannerSide ScannerSide},
 * {@link org.sonar.api.server.ServerSide ServerSide} and/or {@link org.sonar.api.ce.ComputeEngineSide ComputeEngineSide}
 * (referred to below as "component") that can be started and stopped.
 * <p>
 * The method {@link #start()} is called at the begin of the component lifecycle.
 * It can be called again only after a call to {@link #stop()}. The {@link #stop()} method is called at the end of the
 * component lifecycle, and can further be called after every {@link Startable#start()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the WebServer, a component is started once: either right when the WebServer is started if there is no migration,
 * otherwise only after Database has been successfully migrated. It is stopped once when the WebServer is shutdown. Any
 * exception thrown by method {@link #start()} will make the WebServer startup fail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the Compute Engine, a component is started once when the Compute Engine is started and stopped once when the
 * ComputeEngine is shut down. Any exception thrown by method {@link #start()} will make the Compute Engine startup fail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * On Scanner side, the lifecycle of a component depends on the value of the {@link org.sonar.api.batch.InstantiationStrategy
 * InstantiationStrategy} annotation.
